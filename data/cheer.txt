Keep going – even the best programmers started out writing 'Hello World'!
Your code might crash, but you won't!
Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.
One bug at a time, one solution closer.
Never stop learning – the tech world moves fast, and so should you.
A bad day coding beats a good day doing anything else.
